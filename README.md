# 💻 MERN Stack Developer – Proof of Work

Hi, I’m **Ragulashiva Shankar**, a passionate MERN Stack developer in the making. This repository serves as my **digital portfolio and proof of work** as I learn, build, and grow in full-stack web development.

Here, I will continuously upload my practical work, mini-projects, and experiments covering:

- 🟢 **MongoDB** – Database modeling, queries, and aggregation
- 🟡 **Express.js** – RESTful APIs, middleware, authentication
- 🔵 **React.js** – UI components, hooks, state management
- 🔴 **Node.js** – Server-side logic and performance tuning

## 🚀 My Learning Goal

> "Not just to learn the MERN stack, but to master it through real, working projects."

This repo is **not just about notes or theory** — everything I add here will reflect real skills through working code.

You’ll find:
- Hands-on project folders
- Practice with real-world scenarios
- Incremental builds of full-stack apps
- Clean code and documentation

⬜ REST API with Express  
⬜ MongoDB CRUD Practice  
⬜ React UI Components  
⬜ MERN Full App  
⬜ Authentication & JWT  
⬜ Deployment to Render/Netlify

## 🧠 Why This Matters

This repository is a living record of:
- What I’ve **actually built**
- How I **approach and solve problems**
- My growth from **learner → job-ready developer**

If you're a recruiter, collaborator, or mentor — this is where you’ll see my commitment and consistency.
